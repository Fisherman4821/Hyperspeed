    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Exposed public APIs for `SplineUtility.ReverseFlow`, `SplineUtility.JoinSplinesOnKnots`, and  `SplineUtility.SplitSplineOnKnot`.\n\n### Changed\n\n- For Editor versions of 2023.2 or newer, added clipboard operations for Splines to the Scene view context menu.\n- Changed `Splines/Cycle Active Spline` shortcut to Shift-S to remove a conflict with Unity default shortcuts.\n- [SPLB-163] Improved performance of spline handles by caching spline data.\n- [SPLB-167] Changed the evaluation of up vectors to use a cache instead of re-evaluate the values on every single request.\n- In Editor versions of 2023.2 or newer, moved the following actions from the Element Inspector to the Scene view context menu: Link, Unlink, Split, Join, and Reverse Spline Flow. \n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- [SPLB-176] Fixed a regression where the up vector would not evaluate correctly for some curves.\n- Fixed the setter for SplineAnimate.Normalized time to handle ping-pong direction correctly when set.\n- Fixed a bug where setting the time value to 0 after reaching the end of the spline animation was not resetting the object position.\n- [SPLB-169] Fixed a bug where `CurveUtility.GetNearestPoint` would return incorrect values for the interpolation."
